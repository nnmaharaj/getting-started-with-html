<h1>In Summation</h1>

<b>Web basics</b>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes"><b>World Wide Web</b></a> is composed of html documents that are linked together via hyper links.
<b>Servers</b> serve up <em>html pages</em> that <em>travel through</em> the <a href="http://website.informer.com/visit?domain=wwwdotcom.com"><b>internet</b></a> and to the <b>user's</b> <em>browser</em>. 
<em>HTML</em> stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
<b>HTPP</b> is the protocol via which web pages served by servers <em>travel through</em> the internet. 
The <em>browser</em> interprets the html document into human legible prose and style.

<p><b>Tags!</b> 
They are everywhere...in HTML that is. 
They have contents in the middle, and are flanked on both sides by the tag name.
The left side of the tag is called the <em>opening tag</em> while the right side of the tag is called the <em>closing tag</em>.
The closing tag typically has a <em>forward slash</em> before the tag name. Examples include: <br>
1. The <em>b</em> tag aka the bold tag. <br>
2. The <em>em</em> tag aka the italics or emphasis tag. <br>
<p>

<p><b>Attributes!</b> Attributes equal a value in the opening tag. Examples include: <br>
1. The anchor tag, <em>a href="www.youdon'tsay.com"</em>. <br>
2. The image tag, <em>img src="source.url.com" alt="text"</em>. It is known as a <em>void tag</em> because it has no content. Without content there is no need for a forward slash in the closing tag. <br>
<p>

<p><b>Whitespace!</b> The following tags control white space: <br>
1. The line break tag, <em>br</em>, also a <em>void tag</em>. Works as an <b>in-line</b> element. <br>
2. The paragraph tag, <em>p</em>. Works as a <b>block</b> element. <br>
3. The span element, <em>span</em>. It is an <em>in-line</em> element. Styles can be added to this element. <br>
4. The div element, <em>div</em>. It is a <em>block</em> element. Styles can be added to this element.
